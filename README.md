# Recent Updates: Set up basics of connecting to Zoho CRM. BUT, it is unable to send the permit currently. (and get back the status too later on)

Recently set up django. Use the backend folder if you are doing backend stuff. You will have to open both the frontend and backend folder at the same time on vscode (or whatever editor you use.. i believe that you can't run the frontend normally either) will have to figure out a way to host it without local host so don't need to do this.

Tasks:
- Style the website + add department names/info
- Permit backend!
