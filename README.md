# Recent Updates: Basic login page and page routes

Try to avoid working on other parts than your own to prevent code conflicts. But if you do, check the code.

Recently set up django. Use the backend folder if you are doing backend stuff. You will have to open both the frontend and backend folder at the same time on vscode (or whatever editor you use.. i believe that you can't run the frontend normally either) will have to figure out a way to host it without local host so don't need to do this.

Currently, the register form is broken and redirects do not work. Also need to find a way to require a strict password, just frontend side not working.

But should be able to create permit for users and work on the email API currently.
