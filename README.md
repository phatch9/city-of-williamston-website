# Recent Updates: Basic login page and page routes

Recently set up django. Use the backend folder if you are doing backend stuff. You will have to open both the frontend and backend folder at the same time on vscode (or whatever editor you use.. i believe that you can't run the frontend normally either) will have to figure out a way to host it without local host so don't need to do this.

Tasks:
- Style the website
- Add the department names
- Permit backend

Known Issues to Fix: 
- users that are added aren't able to be accessed by other computers (check??)
- password warning if common password
- the actual errors should be shown in the frontend, not be generic (for the register/login page)
