# Recent Updates: Basic login page and page routes

Try to avoid working on other parts than your own to prevent code conflicts. But if you do, check the code.

Recently set up Django. Use the backend folder if you are doing backend stuff. You will have to open both the frontend and backend folder at the same time on vscode (or whatever editor you use..) and will have to figure out a way to host it without a local host so don't need to do this.

There are still a few issues with the register (requiring strict passwords and specific messages) but done for now. Get other components finished.

Should be able to create permits for users and work on the email API currently.
