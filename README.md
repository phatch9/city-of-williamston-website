# Recent Updates: Basic login page and page routes

Recently set up django. Use the backend folder if you are doing backend stuff. You will have to open both the frontend and backend folder at the same time on vscode (or whatever editor you use.. i believe that you can't run the frontend normally either) will have to figure out a way to host it without local host so don't need to do this.

Currently there is a basic template for the frontend, but the department/division pages do not lead to anything. It is also unstyled. The only component that functions in the backend is just the log in/register page. The permit and contact us forms do not do anything.

Goal: Finish dept/division pages, style the frontend, and at least get somewhat started on permit/contact us form (don't think need to work yet?? just an idea for the documentation part..)
